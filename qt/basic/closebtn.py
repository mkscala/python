       '''The event processing system in PyQt5 is built with the signal & slot mechanism. If we click on the button, the signal clicked is emitted. The slot can be a Qt slot or any Python callable. The QCoreApplication contains the main event loopâ€”it processes and dispatches all events. The instance() method gives us its current instance. Note that QCoreApplication is created with the QApplication. The clicked signal is connected to the quit() method which terminates the application. The communication is done between two objects: the sender and the receiver. The sender is the push button, the receiver is the application object.
