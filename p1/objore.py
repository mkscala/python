In python3, urllib has been split into urllib.request and urllib.error. 
See note at the top of the urllib2 page. The function you are looking for is contained in urllib.request. Try the following:


page = urlopen("https://docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.html")
contents = page.read()


'''
'''class — Tell Python to make a new kind of thing.
• object — Two meanings: the most basic kind of thing, and any instance of some thing.
• instance — What you get when you tell Python to create a class.
• def — How you define a function inside a class.
• self — Inside the functions in a class, self is a variable for the instance/object being accessed.
• inheritance — The concept that one class can inherit traits from another class, much like
you and your parents.
• composition — The concept that a class can be composed of other classes as parts, much
like how a car has wheels.
• attribute — A property classes have that are from composition and are usually variables.
• is- a — A phrase to say that something inherits from another, as in a “salmon” is- a “fish.”
• has- a — A phrase to say that something is composed of other things or has a trait, as in “a
salmon has- a mouth.

Why do I need self when I make __init__ or other functions for classes?

If you don’t have self, then code like cheese = 'Frank' is ambiguous. That code isn’t clear
about whether you mean the instance’s cheese attribute or a local variable named cheese. With
self.cheese = 'Frank' it’s very clear you mean the instance attribute self.cheese.
