'''
len(d) -  number of stored entries, i.e. the number of (key,value) pairs.
del d[k] -	deletes the key k together with his value
k in d - True, if a key k exists in the dictionary d
k not in d -	True, if a key k doesn't exist in the dictionary d
if "car" in words: print words["car"]
w = words.copy() -  copy dic words to w
w.clear() - clear content of a dictionary w
w.update(w1) - merges the keys and values of w1  dictionary into w


Iterating over a Dictionary
 for key in d:
	print (key)

But it's possible to use the method iterkeys():

for key in d.iterkeys():
	print (key)

The method itervalues() is a convenient way for iterating directly over the
values:
for val in d.itervalues():
	print (val)
The above loop is of course equivalent to the following one:
for key in d:
	print (d[key])


Lists from Dictionaries
w={"house":"Haus","cat":"Katze","red":"rot"}
>>> w.items()
>>> w.keys()

Dictionaries from Lists
 We have the  nect  two  lists
 dishes = ["pizza", "sauerkraut", "paella", "Hamburger"]
 countries = ["Italy", "Germany", "Spain", "USA"]
 Use  the next command
 country_specialities = zip(countries, dishes)
 The  result is the  next 2-tuple list :
  country_specialities = [('Italy', 'pizza'), ('Germany', 'sauerkraut'),
  ('Spain', 'paella'), ('USA', 'Hamburger')]
  The  next  command will   transform  it in to dic
  country_specialities_dict = dict(country_specialities)
