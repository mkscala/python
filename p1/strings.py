len('rty):  length      s.lower():lowercase    s.upper():      str(2):  turns non-strings into strings!
capitalize() - Returns the string with first letter capitalized and the rest lowercased.
casefold() - Returns a lowercase string, generally used for caseless matching. This is more aggressive than the lower() method.
center() - Center the string within the specified width with optional fill character.
count() - Count the non-overlapping occurrence of supplied substring in the string.
encode() - Return the encoded version of the string as a bytes object.
endswith() - Returns ture if the string ends with the supplied substring.
expandtabs() - Return a string where all the tab characters are replaced by the supplied number of spaces.
find() - Return the index of the first occurrence of supplied substring in the string. Return -1 if not found.
format() - Format the given string.
format_map() - Format the given string.
index() - Return the index of the first occurrence of supplied substring in the string. Raise ValueError if not found.
isalnum() - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are alphanumeric.
isalpha() - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are alphabetic.
isdecimal() - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are decimal characters.
isdigit() - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are digits.
isidentifier() - Return true if the string is a valid identifier.
islower() - Return true if the string has all lowercased characters and at least one is cased character.
isnumeric() - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are numeric.
isprintable() - Return true if the string is empty or all characters are printable.
isspace() - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are whitespaces.
istitle() - Return true if the string is non-empty and titlecased.
isupper() - Return true if the string has all uppercased characters and at least one is cased character.
join() - Concatenate strings in the provided iterable with separator between them being the string providing this method.
ljust() - Left justify the string in the provided width with optional fill characters.
lower() - Return a copy of all lowercased string.
lstrip() - Return a string with provided leading characters removed.
maketrans() - Return a translation table.
partition() - Partition the string at first occurrence of substring (separator) and return a 3-tuple with part before separator, the separator and part after separator.
replace() - Replace all old substrings with new substrings.
rfind() - Return the index of the last occurrence of supplied substring in the string. Return -1 if not found.
rindex() - Return the index of the last occurrence of supplied substring in the string. Raise ValueError if not found.
rjust() - Right justify the string in the provided width with optional fill characters.
rpartition() - Partition the string at last occurrence of substring (separator) and return a 3-tuple with part before separator, the separator and part after separator.
rsplit() - Return a list of words delimited by the provided subtring. If maximum number of split is specified, it is done from the right.
rstrip() - Return a string with provided trailing characters removed.
split() - Return a list of words delimited by the provided subtring. If maximum number of split is specified, it is done from the left.
splitlines() - Return a list of lines in the string.
startswith() - Return true if the string starts with the provided substring.
strip() - Return a string with provided leading and trailing characters removed.
swapcase() - Return a string with lowercase characters converted to uppercase and vice versa.
title() - Return a title (first character of each word capitalized, others lowercased) cased string.
translate() - Return a copy of string that has been mapped according to the provided map.
upper() - Return a copy of all uppercased string.
zfill() - Return a numeric string left filled with zeros in the provided width.
